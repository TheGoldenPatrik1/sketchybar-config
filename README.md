# SketchyBar Config

This repository is my personal configuration for [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar), a macOS plugin to customize the top menu bar. My configuration is largely derived from [this repository](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles).

## Notable Enhancements

- **Battery Health** information, displayed when the Battery Widget is clicked.
- Redesigned **Calendar Widget** that takes up less space and opens Google Calendar when clicked.
- **Restart Widget** to refresh SketchyBar; useful for development.
- **RAM Widget** that displays the current RAM utilization, along with a graph.
- **Weather Widget** that displays current temperature and conditions, with a pop-up menu displaying semi-hourly forecast for the next two days.
